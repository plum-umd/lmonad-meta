- add bibifi - performance
- close tradeoff loop
- comparison to coq
- 4 minutes extra
- more in the paper: slide of extra stuff i didnt talk about at the end
- selective declassification

- related work

Robert
- spend more time on contributions slide
- don't add too much
- diagram of lattice

- explain label annotation example more
- tweak friends example to something else (Bank + account?)

(Some already discussed)

Is it really pronounced yes-id? (Hebrew: yi-SODE, don’t know what Haskellers say.)
I’d clarify “first type theoretic result in liquid Haskell” (if that's what you said).

Is flow just subset or are you eliding a connection?

Talk through examples on slide! (For database policies in particular.)

Why is meet “or”? [Alice or Bob] (Typically meet = and, join = or.)

Database policies: Maybe give user1 and user2 non-bottom labels?

It would be nice to see something that looks like a database, and step through the process of labelling it.

General:
- Too much text and bullets. Think about how to add pictures, etc.
- Put code examples at the top. Otherwise might not be visible to people in the back
- Add slide numbers
- Slide of stuff that’s in the paper that you didn’t talk about
- Backup slide on related work
- Need to mention somewhere that we support selective declassification

Slide 2 (Motivation): I wouldn’t elaborate on the bullets at the bottom; just say them. Details will come later.

Slide 3 (Contributions):
- Say that BIBIFI site is > 11.5K LOC with 40 tables and handles hundreds of users

Slide (LIO):
- It’s not a lattice, but a join semi-lattice, or something like that. Figure out the right technical term.

Slide (LIO) again:
- Have a different title for each of the LIO slides (It can be LIO: XXX where XXX is the topic on the slide)
- Typo: “noninteference”

Slide (LIO) again (with LIO current label example)
- Can you animate this?
- Need to explain current label better (per my comment during your talk)
- Change the example to have a real information flow
[2 minute delay to answer question]

Yesod (second slide)
- Show example Esqeleto query. Should only add 10 seconds to your talk, but will be cool

Database policies
- Highlight the policy for Alice and Bob at the bottom when showing the example (make Field … parts red, say)
- Try to point out how these policies might differ from related work, at this point? E.g., this is the first system that XXX

Semantics slide
- Point out that you are basically doing this by making an interpreter. I.e., you are not setting them up as inference rules. Perhaps show a whole function, to illustrate, but don’t go into the details.
- For the example: Lots of syntax people will not understand here. You will need to walk them through it more. Maybe gray out the uninteresting parts?

Noninterference slide
- put the p1 and p2 parts on separate lines to make it easier to read

1:50pm.

Should have stuff about the implementation, BIBIFI (e.g., changes to the application required — annotations etc. and also how often declassification needed), evaluation, LH vs. Coq … !
